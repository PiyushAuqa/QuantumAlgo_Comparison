# Quantum Algoritms are implemented by using Jupyter Notebook in Qiskit 1.2.4 
This study compares multiple quantum algorithms— Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE), Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), Quantum Parallel Multi-layer Monte Carlo (QPMC) with QAE, and Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Optimization (QIEO)—to optimize power extraction from solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and bladeless wind turbines (Bl-WT). The respective datasets have also been added.
